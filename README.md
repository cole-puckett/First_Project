# First_Project

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the average of the grades entered by the user. This is my first personal project.

## Features
- Prompts user for a grade 
- Handles invalid inputs (inputs outside of the 0 - 100 range)
- Calculates the average and outputs it as well as the corresponding letter grade 

## Future Improvements
- Output median, highest, and lowest grades
- Save and load grades from a text file
- Handle invalid inputs (non-numerical and not the stop command)

## What I learned
- Converting between a string and numeric values to allow for a stop command as a word
- Validating inputs from the user
- Organizing code into functions for cleaner and more clear structure

## How to Run
Compile and run using any C++ compiler:
g++ GradeCalculator.cpp -o grade_calculator

./grade_calculator
